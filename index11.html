  <p>The African Union has postponed a conference that was due to take place in Tunisia this month after criticism over a government crackdown and racial attacks against sub-Saharan nationals. An African Union spokeswoman told the news agency by text message on Monday that the conference on fighting illicit financial flows in Africa scheduled for mid-March has been postponed. No new host country has been chosen for the meeting. The African Union issued a statement on February 24 urging Tunisia to “refrain from racialized hate speech that could bring people to harm”. The AU Commission said it had called Tunisia’s representative for an urgent meeting to register “deep shock and concern at the form and substance” of the remarks on behalf of the continent-wide bloc.</p>

  <p>Mali’s embassy said it expected to fly home about 150 people on the same day. The Guinean military government was the first to bring back some 50 nationals on Wednesday evening. Alseny Barry, a Guinean citizen repatriated from Tunisia, told Al Jazeera that conditions had been “very difficult”. “We live in hell,” he said. “When we go out they catch us and they put us in jail. They have prepared a special prison for sub-Saharan Africans, when they catch you they send you there.”</p>
